## Grafana for SORMAS

### Setup
Start the complete deployment with `docker-compose up -d`. After the stack has started, navigate to localhost:3000 and 
login with `admin:admin`. There is a `SORMAS Main` dashboard which you can use as a starting point. After you added some
data to the database, you can start to create visualizations :)

### Questions/Todo
- [ ] Store data in postgres?
- [ ] Can we use keycloak for user authentication?
- [ ] Go through the config file and remove everything we don't need!
